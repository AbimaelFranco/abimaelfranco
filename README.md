## 🚀 About Me

I’m an Electronics Engineer currently finishing my bachelor’s and pursuing a Master’s in Industrial Management. I'm passionate about technological innovation, especially where **software and hardware meet** — from automation and intelligent systems to data analysis and embedded development.

I’ve participated in international training programs in **semiconductor technology** in Taiwan and worked on projects involving **sign language translation**, **humidity control systems**, and **AI-powered solutions**.
